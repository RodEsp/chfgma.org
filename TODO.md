# Comments from Lawrence

## About
### Desktop

Use original image quality (I know that this is a question you had for @Katy Ma on the figma)
The mission statement is title case when it should be sentence case. Also, the kerning and spacing is off compared to the wireframes
Can we move the pixels around on the Help CTAs so they match the wireframes as well?
Looks like the fonts don’t match, is this a web font issue?
Generally text kerning and spacing is a bit tight, closer we can match it to the wireframes, the better
Mobile

[GLOBAL] The header in all pages just says Mutual Aid, can we change this to Clinton Hill Fort Greene Mutual Aid?
Can we introduce more spacing for the mission statement? As it is now, it’s very tightly sandwiched by the images
The image in the ‘Since March 2020’ section is cut off
With the Instagram updates panes here, could we do a carousel instead? Not sure if there is functionality to have panes in desktop and a carousel in mobile

## Get Help
Desktop

[GLOBAL] Match typeface, kerning, and spacing with wireframe
Headline doesn’t match dimensions from wireframes; also, can we make the type bold
‘Submit a request’ dimensions should match wireframes as well, feels a little squashed at the moment
Same with  ‘Other Resources’ section
Mobile
Can we have ‘Request Aid’ CTA after the ‘Some ways we can help’ box?
